			I love you.
			<br />
			<p>(In case you forgot)</p>
			<p>And I want to make your birthday special. <br />
			I know this isn't a card, but I figured I'd shake things up. <br />
			After all, I've gotta put this programming knowledge to use somehow. <br />
			So it may not be a card, but it's homemade!</p>

			Your birthday only comes around once a year <br />
			And it's certainly a time to celebrate. Another year with you in this world is a better one. <br />
			You've been the biggest gift in the world to me. I can only ohpe you'd consider me a present.<br />
			I love you with all my heart, forever and always mines.
